    =====================
 This is my "Hello World" project for IS1003. 

 _My name is Michael Denman, and here's a little bit about me. I am a former U.S. Air Force member with experience in aircraft maintenance and intelligence analysis._
 
 _In my personal life I am a full-time employee working in the cyber market-place, and I'm going to UTSA part time to further my education and improve myself. I am family oriented, somewhat adventurous, and a highly motivated person._

 _I hope to improve my foundations in cyber security through this and many other courses through UTSA._
